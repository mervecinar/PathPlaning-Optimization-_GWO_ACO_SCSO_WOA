# Path Planning Optimization with GWO, ACO, SCSO, and WOA Algorithms

This repository presents a comprehensive comparison of four optimization algorithms applied to the path planning problem: Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). The study aims to analyze the performance of each algorithm using convergence curves and boxplots, and to evaluate them based on their best, worst, average, and standard deviation results.

## Overview

Path planning is a crucial aspect of various fields such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and logistics. The goal is to find the most efficient route from a starting point to a destination while avoiding obstacles. This repository provides implementations and performance evaluations of four different optimization algorithms applied to the path planning problem.
